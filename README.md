# Livesplit-tools
This small project currently allows comparing your latest run to a set of standards and saves stats of those comparisons to allow seeing over time trends in your success rates at certain splits.

## New feature ideas
There is a ton of things that could be done with a livesplit file. If you are interested in any of these or have your own ideas feel free to bring them up and it'll probably motivate me more to actually implement them.

*save and display more complex stats about latest run
*compare best segments between 2 sets of splits
*compare PB's between 2 sets of splits


## Guide to using
1. Put readAllTimeStats.py and saveLatest.py to the same folder as your livesplit file.
2. Create a standards file(or use the example one in this project) and put that into the same folder as your livesplit file as well.
3. Install python if you don't have it [here] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Run the python files as you see fit :)
